2.1.1 Card Class

The card in version 4 meant to replace the panel the well and the thumbnail from version 3. They group contents togheter in some kind of container and the card class is now used to replace all three of those.

.card
.card-img-top - attached the img to the top of the card
.card-block - for th body content
.card-title - to style the title

.img-fluid - resize the image to fit widthin it's container - it's the same as the img-responsive in version 3.

=================================
2.2 Stubborn Bootstrap Selectors
=================================

In the navbar:
.navbar-dark
.bg-inverse

The anchor tags in the navbar:
.nav-link

To change the color on the nav-links:
.navbar-dark .navbar-nav .nav-link { color: red; }

We have to be so specific as bootstrap.

We need to be sure that our rules are just so specific or more specific then bootstrap selectors.

A trick is to inspect elements on the page with the dev tools.
